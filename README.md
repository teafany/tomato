## 🍅 TomatoTimer

TomatoTimer is a Chrome extension I built to help students (like me!) stay on track with their work

It combines structured time management, a built-in to-do list, and a background gameplay subtle motivation tool

This project was created as part of UF’s WiCSE Shadowing Program, with mentorship from American Express

This extension follows the Pomodoro method:
- 25 minutes of focused work
- 5-minute short break
- After 4 rounds, a longer 15 minute break to recharge

### 📋 To-Do List Feature
A built-in to-do list inspired by productivity tools like Notion:
- Add tasks before or during your session
- Each task has dropdowns for *status*, *priority*, and *session*
- ✔ marks tasks as complete
- ✘ deletes tasks you no longer need
- Completed tasks get moved to a separate section for progress tracking

### 🎥 Focus Feature
Need background stimulation?
- Pick from 3 games: Minecraft, Subway Surfers, or Papa’s Sushiria
- Embedded videos support *Picture-in-Picture*
- Easily switch between games with dedicated buttons
